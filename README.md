Practical machine learning, Coursera
=======
This report finalizes a course project of Practical Machine Learning June 2014 [ 1 ], a course delivered by staff of John Hopkins University Jeff Leek, Brian Caffo, and Roger D. Peng via Coursera. This course project was inspired by a human activity recognition (HAR) project [ 2 , 3 ].
This HAR project was researching qualitative physical activity recognition, in different words how well an activity was executed. Six young adults were executing ten repetition of the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl in five manners: (A) exactly according to the specification, (B) throwing the elbows to the front, (C) lifting the dumbbell only halfway, (D) lowering the dumbbell only halfway, (E) throwing the hips to the front, where B â€“ E represent common mistakes. These executions were recorded via four sensors on the belt, arm, forearm, and dumbbell.
Data from this HAR project was delivered to the course students in two datasets, a training dataset of 19622 observations and 158 variables plus a manner 'classe' variable, and a testing dataset of 20 observations and 158 variables without 'classe' variable. The course project's objective is to predict the manner 'classe' of the testing dataset.
